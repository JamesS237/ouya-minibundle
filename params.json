{"name":"Ouya Mini Bundle","body":"ouya-minibundle \r\n========== \r\n \r\nThe Ouya Mini Bundle is a bundle of several small, open source games. \r\n \r\nGames will be bundled into a pack that can be downloaded on the [Ouya](http://ouya.tv) game console. There purpose is to  \r\nintroduce gamers to the console. The source code will be released so new developers can see how they work. \r\n \r\nThe games should have an emphasis on the OUYA's unique features, if possible. \r\n \r\nThe project is led by James Spencer (JamesS237) and Josh Siegl (sodafountan). \r\n \r\nTo contribute a game, you must first alert us on this [Ouya Dev Forum Thread](http://forums.ouya.tv/discussion/432/lets-do-a-bundle). \r\nAnd then send a pull request. \r\n \r\nRules: \r\n------ \r\n1. Games must be enclosed in their own folder. \r\n2. Games must be in Java. (No Unity/Air/etc.) \r\n3. Games must be open source (License is your choice, but be OSS)\r\n \r\nHappy Game Dev!\r\n","tagline":"Ouya Mini Bundle","note":"Don't delete this file!
