========== 
 
The Ouya Mini Bundle is a bundle of several small, open source games. 
 
Games will be bundled into a pack that can be downloaded on the [Ouya](http://ouya.tv) game console. There purpose is to  
introduce gamers to the console. The source code will be released so new developers can see how they work. 
 
The games should have an emphasis on the OUYA's unique features, if possible. 
 
The project is led by me (JamesS237) and Josh Siegl (sodafountan). 
 
To contribute a game, you must first alert us on this [Ouya Dev Form Thread](http://forums.ouya.tv/discussion/432/lets-do-a-bundle). 
And then send a pull request. 
 
Rules: 
------ 
1. Games must be enclosed in their own folder. 
2. Games must be in Java. (No Unity/Air/etc.) 
3. Games must be open source (License is your choice 
 
Happy Game Dev!
